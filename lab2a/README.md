# Lab 2a

The first part of the lab includes adding the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to your robot and successfully producing in CM in the serial monitor. Follow along with part 1 of the lab video. I will be providing 1 sensor in class on Monday. I will also bring a hot glue gun into school to help mount the sensor if you wish to do it there. You are welcome to do it on your own as well. I will provide you 4 wires, but you will be responsible for correct wiring (the video has a guide).

## Submission for this lab includes:

- Your code either as pasted text or attached .ino file.
- A picture of your robot placed 12" away from a wall with some sort of measuring tool (a ruler is sufficient) and the accompanying screenshot of your serial monitor showing the distance reported.
- If there are any deviations for your robot from the ~30.5 cm report why you think you are seeing the results you are.
