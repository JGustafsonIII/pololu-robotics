# Lab 2b

The second part of the lab creates the object following behavior displayed in the second lab video. This lab is largely following along with the video, getting accustomed to working with sensor data and robot dynamics. When you demo this lab in class on week 5 I will be looking for accuracy, smoothness and dynamics control. I want you to show that you are comfortable using the sensor data and actuators to create a Braitenberg like behavior of wall following. Your robot will be tested by following an object in our in-class demo.

You must have completed lab 2a to be able to finish this lab.

Submit your code here in the assignment, your robot will be graded during week 5 class.
